# Excel-Project
Answers to strategic business questions.

The project was designed to address key business questions essential for management decision-making. It focused on providing a comprehensive analysis of the company’s supplier base, product brands, and categories. One of the primary objectives was to assess the number of suppliers, brands, and categories to better understand the company’s market position and potential for expansion.

Additionally, the project aimed to evaluate the company's year-on-year growth in terms of profitability, offering insights into overall financial performance. This analysis was crucial in identifying trends and areas where the company has experienced growth or potential declines, thereby enabling management to make informed strategic decisions.

Another important aspect of the project involved assessing each brand's market share. By calculating the proportion of market share held by each brand, the company could better understand competitive positioning and identify opportunities to strengthen or expand its brand portfolio.

Furthermore, the project included the calculation of year-to-date (YTD) profit, providing a snapshot of the company’s profitability within the current fiscal year. This was complemented by the calculation of the moving annual total (MAT), which offered a rolling assessment of the company’s financial performance over a 12-month period. These metrics provided valuable insights into both short-term and long-term financial health.

Overall, the analysis was instrumental in providing management with actionable data to guide strategic decisions and ensure sustained profitability in a competitive market environment.
